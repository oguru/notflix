# Movie Database App

## Description
An app to search for movies, TV shows and games, and display them on a user friendly UI with card components showing posters, name, genre and ratings (if detailed mode is on). Clicking the card opens a modal to show more information on a result. Fully responsive with adaptive navbar on mobile screens.

## Still To Do
* Extend to add authentication, so the user can log in, save their favourite movies, and give them a personal score.
* Build UI for sign up and log in.
* Optimise code to make it more responsive.
* Experiment with useReducer instead of useState in some components.
